## Step 1: Clone the Repository

To begin working on the assignment, clone the repository to your local machine. Follow the instructions in [**CLONE_REPO.md**](CLONE_REPO.md) for a detailed guide on how to clone the repository.

## Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with Git Commands

Before you start making changes, it's crucial to understand basic Git commands. Refer to [**GIT_COMMAND_INSTRUCTION.md**](GIT_COMMAND_INSTRUCTION.md) for a comprehensive guide. Below are some essential commands for quick reference:

```bash
# Check the current branch
git branch

# Switch to a different branch
git checkout branch-name

# Check the status of your working directory
git status

# Add changes to the staging area
git add file1 file2 ...    # Add specific files
git add --all              # Add all changes

# Commit the staged changes
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Merge branches (Ensure you only merge your branch into 'testing' to avoid issues)
git checkout testing
git merge branch-name
```
